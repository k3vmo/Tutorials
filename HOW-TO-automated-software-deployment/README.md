#automated-software-deployment

When we began implementing [JAMF Pro](https://www.jamf.com/products/jamf-pro/) in our development and production environments, we had a very specific set of requirements in mind for policy based software deployments.

- Must be able to new deploy software.
- Must be able to update software.
- Must be able to remove software.
- Must be automated with little administrator interaction.
